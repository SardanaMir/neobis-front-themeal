# The Meal

Hello! I'd to like present 'The Meal' app. The app helps you to find some meal's receipe with description of ingredients, photo of meal and instruction how to cook.
In the welcome page you find the meal of the day. You can type an image or a title and head to recipe page. <br>
Or you can find your interested recipe and enter a keyword in the input area.
